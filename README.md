## What is this repository?

<table><tr><td><samp>TL;DR: A collection of event sourcing knowledge.</samp></td></tr></table>

The code in this repository is meant to demonstrate how an ecommerce backend can be built using event sourcing (a data storage technique, or paradigm if you will) along with related concepts frequently employed.

The eventual goal is to have something a bit more "realistic" than what is typically found on public code repositories. That is to say the code will be a bit more hardened and include edge cases most developers typically see in production code and not in examples.

Another goal of this repository is to showcase different technologies working in tandem, as one would see in a polyglot programming environment.

On that note...


## Technologies, frameworks, and libraries, oh my!

A major goal of this project is to use modern tools to demonstrate different ways to interact with [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/eventstoredb), the event-native database that was written from the ground up for [Event Sourcing](https://www.eventstore.com/event-sourcing).

<table><tr><td><samp>HAVE A SUGGESTION?</samp></td></tr></table>

Is there a library, framework, or other piece of tech you would like to see here? Simply open an issue, pull request, or contact me directly (see above).  I would love to hear more about what you think should be highlighted here.

Right! Let's list out some of the technologies used:

### Runtimes

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
  - AKA [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), using [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - TODO

### Databases (data storage)

#### Event Store

- [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com/eventstoredb)

[![blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/EventStore-DB-brightgreen)](https://www.eventstore.com/)

#### EventStoreDB Libraries
- [Eventuous](https://eventuous.dev/)
  - modules: catalog, inventory
- [MicroPlumberd](https://github.com/modelingevolution/micro-plumberd)
  - modules: pricing
- [Emmet](https://event-driven-io.github.io/emmett/)
  - modules: *likely* retail (TBD)
    - includes storefront, carts, and checkout
      - they are part of the public facing frontend and everything can be written in TypeScript


#### Other Databases (queries, read models, analysis, etc)

- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/)
    - legacy module
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft_SQL_Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-sql-server&logoColor=white" alt="sql server" /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white" alt="postgresql" /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Elastic_Search-005571?style=for-the-badge&logo=elasticsearch&logoColor=white" alt="elasticsearch" />


### Testing
- [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit)
- [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions)
- [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly)

### Auxiliary and implicit dependencies
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
- [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)

### Serialization of data inside an (EventStoreDB) event body
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
  - While other options are available, JSON is the default for ESDB.
  - Why? The Projections subsystem inside ESDB works with JSON.
  - This is very handy when solving a *temporal correlation query*. [More information here](https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v5/projections.html#introduction-to-projections).

## Documentation

Coming soon.


## Roadmap

More details coming soon.

In the meantime, check out how the modules of code are broken up:

### Value Streams 

Value Streams are a core concept in [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/). To Grossly simplify, think departments, divisions, or teams within a company.  That is, *organizing business and technology teams for fast flow.*

Below is the loosely proposed structure after initial [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and [discovery](https://www.techmagic.co/blog/project-discovery-phase-in-software-development/) is done. Which is another way of saying this is all subject to change. üòÅ

- ### **Retail** üõí
  - storefront 
  - cart
  - checkout
- ### **Catalog** üìù
  - pricing
  - products
  - listings
- ### **Ordering** üì¶
  - orders
  - payments
  - customers
- ### **Supply Chain** üöö (formerly Inventory)
  - inventories (warehouse)
  - procurement (inbound)
  - fulfillment (outbound)
- ### **Data Analysis** üî¨
  - data science
  - data reporting

### Disclaimer about similarities

Names, structure, and hierarchy are based on personal experiences and opinions derived from time spent in the ecommerce industry. They do not reflect the inner workings of any specific singular system, team, or organization.


## Compatibility

At this time it is preferred you build the projects on your machine directly, the traditional way.

In the future there will be an easier way to choose between running modules traditionally or with Docker.

As this time the background services, such as the databases, are ran inside of Docker containers.

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white">](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation Requirements

1. Install the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 

TODO: optional to have projects built within Docker and not require the .NET SDK to be installed.

## How To Run

### Clone the repo

Clone the repository via your preferred method. For example, using the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erikshafer/event-sourcing-ecommerce
```

### Build via terminal

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the repository.

Build the dotnet solution (AKA the container of projects) with the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
dotnet build
```

If you see no errors and a `Build succeeded.` message output, that means all the dotnet requirements were met. Hooray!

### Start services in Docker via terminal

Besure that after Docker is installed it is also actively running, otherwise the commands below will result in a `Docker daemon is not running` error.  

Run the following command to have Docker begin running (detached, so you can still use your terminal) all background services, such as databases, sinks, etc:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This may take a moment to complete if this is your first time running the code. Specifically if you need to pull down the Docker images and then run the containers.

If there are no visible errors and you see a `Running 6/6` message output, all the Docker components, AKA the background services, are running successfully. Hooray!

### End services in Docker via terminal

As we ran `docker-compose` as a detached process, so we can continue to use the same terminal, we will need to manually stop the services as well with docker's compose feature. That can be done with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you didn't run Docker detached earlier (with no `-d` param), you can just escape out of the process with CTRL+C or whatever the binding is on your machine.

Check the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/features-uses/) for more details.

### Running the API projects

To be finished (TBF). üë∑üöß

As more vertical slices and implemented and projects are more fleshed out as a whole.

**TL;DR:** execute `dotnet run` where applicable. If you're a dotnet developer you likely know what to do!


## Notes to Self 

This is not an [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/).
üéµ [This is a tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lK4cX5xGiQ). üé∂

- **2024-May-01:** Updated dependencies. Resumed exploring MicroPlumberd and Emmet libraries and how they work with EventStoreDB.
  - Oh man. What if there was also a JVM module with Kotlin? And another with Elixir on the Erlang VM? Oh boy. Getting ahead of myself.
    - `dreaming != doing` 
- **2024-April-30:** Spent time on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to map out what modules can highlight different aspects, methods, languages, run-times, and libraries.
- **2024-April-24:** Added MicroPlumberd to the Pricing module and will explore it more soon.
- **2024-April-24:** While you can run the `docker-compose.yml` with success, nothing is working-working.

Work in progress. üë∑üöß


### Thanks

- **Oskar Dudycz** and his [EventSourcing.NetCore](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore) code repository and [event-driven.io](https://event-driven.io/) blog.
  - Oskar's style of developing applications using concepts like CQRS and Event Sourcing has certainly rubbed off on me. That will be evident when looking at some of this very code! Aggregate design especially.
- **Derek Comartin** writes articles on [CodeOpinion.com](https://codeopinion.com/derek-comartin/) and produces accompanying videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeOpinion) of the same name.
- **Greg Young** and his involvement in getting so much of this rolling. His contributions helped this community and interest in this way of storing data get its start. And no, I didn't mean CARS. I mean CQRS!
- **Event Store**, at time of this writing, is my employer! The individuals at Event Store are phenomenal in too many ways to write here. Thank you all for your professional and personal support.
- **JetBrains**, I love your IDEs and Kotlin. That is all.
- More to come!

### Tools Used

Big fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs, such as Rider and IntelliJ IDEA. As well as the Kotlin (JVM) programming language. Big, big fan!
